# Sistema de Administraci√≥n de Proyectos Urbanos (SAPU) #

## Administration System for Urban Projects ##

The following repository contains a Django project developed for the databases course. It was targeted to an architecture office in order to plan and document progress on architectural and urban projects. 

The software is not currently used due to a government administration change, so I opt to open source it if someone finds it useful.
